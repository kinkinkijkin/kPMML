#wav table must contain at least one entry or the compiler will crash

# wav can be any of PULS, SINE, SAWT, TRIA, PCYC.
# PULS duty values less than 200 will slowly morph into a sawtooth and get louder
# PULS duty values more than 200 will morph from a 50% square to an 0.000...1% square as they reach 400
# DO NOT INPUT A FLOAT FOR duty!!!!!!!!

# AMP is inverse!!!!!!! anything below 1 is extremely loud!!!!!!!
# ONLY USE AMP VALUES LESS THAN 1 FOR FM!!!!!!!

/mu the start of the music, you can have as many of these as you want it doesn't matter

# lines can be split arbitrarily
# lengths are in frames of the defined tickrate (xhz line), not fractions!
# you cannot loop within a music macro (labelled jesus below) and cannot use a music macro in loops (will fix)
# loops are defined with ( music )x, where x is times to loop.
